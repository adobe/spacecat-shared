There is a detailed .github/copilot-instructions.md (updated 2026-02-05, 406 lines) that documents coding conventions, schema patterns, data access patterns, breaking-change rules, and repo-specific architectural invariants. Two package-level CLAUDE.md files exist: one for spacecat-shared-google-client (docs/CLAUDE.md, updated 2026-02-05) with architecture diagrams, environment variable tables, and usage examples; and one for spacecat-shared-vault-secrets (CLAUDE.md, updated 2026-02-20) with a detailed architecture diagram, E2E validation runbook, and findings from a live validation. A design document was added recently at docs/plans/2026-02-19-vault-approle-per-service-design.md (updated 2026-02-21), representing AI-assisted architectural planning. A .cursor/commands/ directory contains 10 shared AI commands including speckit.constitution.md for managing a project constitution. The repository falls short of Score 3 because there are no living context files (no active_context.md, tech_debt.md, or product_evolution.md) that are auto-updated by CI/CD. The .specify/ directory referenced by the speckit commands does not exist in the repository, so spec-driven development is defined in the tooling but not yet fully instantiated.

The branch-review.md command explicitly ties AI review to the copilot-instructions.md standards. The .gitignore deliberately excludes speckit.* commands from version control (.cursor/commands/speckit.*) but keeps the branch-review.md, indicating active team use. The repository does not reach Score 3 because the .specify/ directory is absent (spec-driven development is defined but not active in this repo), there are no metrics on AI impact, and there is no evidence of >75% AI usage as a default tool across the team.

This is a substantive Score 2 signal: the copilot-instructions.md acts as a Copilot code reviewer configuration with detailed severity levels (Critical/Major/Minor), specific checks for schema integrity, breaking API changes, data access patterns, HTTP utility patterns, TypeScript definitions, security, and linting. The branch-review.md Cursor command in .cursor/commands/ provides AI-assisted local branch review that references the copilot-instructions.md, creating a pre-PR AI review workflow. The PR template is minimal (2 checkboxes), but the copilot-instructions.md supplements it heavily. The semver-check.yaml workflow auto-comments semantic release status on PRs. CODEOWNERS gates the critical data-access package. CodeQL runs on PRs to main for security analysis. Score 3 is not reached because there are no custom compliance rules beyond what copilot-instructions.md provides, no impact analysis predicting affected downstream services, no continuous quality scanning beyond CI, and no evidence of AI as the automated first-pass reviewer in the GitHub workflow (vs. the instructions being a human-readable guide that Copilot follows when invoked).",

The repository is solidly at an intermediate AI maturity level across all four SDLC phases. Its strongest asset is the copilot-instructions.md file - a comprehensive, recently-updated (2026-02-05) AI review guide that covers schema integrity, breaking changes, data access patterns, testing requirements, and security checks with clear severity levels. This file serves double duty as both a Copilot PR reviewer configuration and an architectural reference. The .cursor/commands/ directory contains a sophisticated 10-command speckit workflow for spec-driven development (specification, clarification, planning, task generation, implementation, analysis, and constitution management), though the .specify/ infrastructure these commands depend on is not yet instantiated in this repo. Testing practices are mature with 100% coverage enforcement, unit+integration test splits, and mandatory integration tests for data-access entities enforced via copilot-instructions.md, but lack a formal TESTING.md and advanced techniques. Package-level CLAUDE.md files exist for 2 of 23 packages with recent, substantive content. The main gaps preventing advancement to 'advanced' are: absence of living context files auto-updated by CI/CD, the speckit workflow not being fully operational in this repo, no TESTING.md, no automated first-pass AI PR review triggering on every push, and no AI impact analysis or productivity metrics."
