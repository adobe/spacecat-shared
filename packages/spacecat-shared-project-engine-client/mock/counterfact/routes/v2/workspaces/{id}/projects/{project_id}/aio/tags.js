/**
 * Stateful handlers for /v2/workspaces/{id}/projects/{project_id}/aio/tags — the project-level AIO
 * tag taxonomy (the Categories surface), modelled as a 1-level tree (see serenity-docs#21): a root
 * category (`category:<name>`, no `parent_id`) can own bare-named children (sub-categories /
 * migrated topics) whose `parent_id` is the root's id. The per-project `tags` collection
 * (`tags:{ws}:{pid}`) is scoped so the same category registered across N market projects keeps N
 * independent collections. Materialized into `.counterfact/routes/` by the mock runner; excluded
 * from coverage.
 *
 * - POST (`createProjectTags`): request `TreeNodeListRequest` `{ names, parent_id? }`; persists
 *   each tag idempotently (deterministic `tag-<name>` id, so a repeated create reuses the tag,
 *   matching the live reuse-by-name) — when `parent_id` is present the created tags are stored as
 *   children under it. Returns the live shape — a TOP-LEVEL ARRAY of `TreeNodeResponse`
 *   `[{ id, name, parent_id?, children_count, keyword_count }]` (verified 2026-06-25; overlay CR6
 *   retypes the 201 as an array). NB the tag id is derived from the name ALONE (shared with
 *   `POST /aio/prompts/tagged`, which only knows names), so two same-named children under different
 *   parents collapse to one id — a documented mock limitation while the live prompt→child-tag
 *   reference contract stays unverified (serenity-docs#21 §7-Q1).
 * - GET (`aio-get-project-tags`): returns the project's stored tags as `AIOTagsListResponse`
 *   `{ items, page, total }`, so a 0-prompt category created via POST reads back. The spec marks
 *   `parent_id` + `search` as required query params (request validation 400s a request missing
 *   either, matching live). The mock is tree-aware: `parent_id=''` (empty) returns ROOTS, a
 *   non-empty `parent_id` returns that category's CHILDREN; a non-empty `search` additionally
 *   filters by case-insensitive name substring. Each returned tag carries a DERIVED
 *   `children_count` (stored tags whose `parent_id` is this tag's id) and, for a child, a `path[]`
 *   breadcrumb (a single leaf: its root category); a root's `path` is `[]`.
 * - DELETE (`aio-delete-tags`): removes the body's tag ids (`BatchDeleteRequest` `{ ids }`) from
 *   the standalone tag collection → 204. Prompts that carry a removed tag are a separate
 *   collection and stay intact (the spec's `prompt_id` query param is accepted but not load-bearing
 *   here — the mock's project-tag delete targets the standalone collection, never cascading to
 *   prompts).
 *
 * Known limitations (edges whose LIVE behaviour is NOT yet verified — serenity-docs#21 §7 — so the
 * mock deliberately does not invent a resolution):
 * - DELETE of a parent category does NOT cascade to, or re-parent, its children: a child left
 *   behind keeps a `parent_id` pointing at the removed root, so it drops out of the roots listing
 *   (`parent_id` is truthy) and is only reachable by querying the now-deleted parent's id. Whether
 *   live Semrush cascades, promotes-to-root, or blocks the delete is unconfirmed (§7).
 * - The tag id is derived from the name (`tag-<name>`, see tag-id.js) but PATCH keeps the id stable
 *   on rename, so after a rename the stored id no longer equals `tagId(currentName)`; a later
 *   create or prompt-tag by the NEW name mints a fresh id and thus a duplicate tag. Faithfully
 *   modelling
 *   this needs the live prompt→child-tag reference contract (id vs name), still open (§7-Q1).
