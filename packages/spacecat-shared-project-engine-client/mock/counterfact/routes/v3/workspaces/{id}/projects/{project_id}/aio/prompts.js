/**
 * Stateful handler for POST /v3/workspaces/{id}/projects/{project_id}/aio/prompts
 * (`aio-create-prompts`, LLMO-6288 WP2 rework) — the v3, metadata-aware create the delivered
 * Semrush swagger defines (2026-07-20). This SUPERSEDES the ADR-shaped `*-with-metadata` PUT
 * family the mock previously modelled against #1818's pre-delivery guess (dropped entirely — see
 * git history). Body `CreateAIOPromptsRequest`: `{ items: [{ name, metadata? }], tag_ids?:
 * [tagId…] }` — `tag_ids` are SHARED across every item, exactly like the sibling v2 id-based
 * create (`aio/prompts.js`'s `POST`). Response 201 `AIOPromptCreateWithMetadataResponse`:
 * `{ items: [{id,name,is_new,metadata}], existing_count }` — ONE RESULT PER REQUEST ITEM, not just
 * the newly-created subset (the delivered swagger's own description: "Response returns per-item
 * {id, name, is_new, metadata}"). Materialized into `.counterfact/routes/` by the mock runner;
 * excluded from coverage — the dedupe / merge / CHECK-constraint logic itself lives in
 * `mock/stateful.js` (`createManyWithMetadata`, unit-tested to 100% branch coverage); this handler
 * only resolves tag ids, meters quota, and shapes the HTTP envelope.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - DEDUPE by prompt NAME (`createManyWithMetadata`): a name already present in the project (in
 *   the store, or earlier in this same batch) is NOT re-created — its result echoes the EXISTING
 *   id and its PRESERVED stored metadata, `is_new: false` (the delivered contract's documented
 *   dedupe behaviour). `tag_ids` attach only to genuinely NEW prompts.
 * - ATOMIC tag_id validation: every `tag_id` is resolved against the project's standalone tag
 *   collection BEFORE any write — an unresolvable id 500s and creates nothing, mirroring the v2
 *   id-based create's atomic contract (no live-verified v3 behaviour exists yet, pending
 *   WP0-live; this is the mock's best-faith carry-over of the sibling endpoint).
 * - ATOMIC metadata CHECK: any item whose `metadata` breaks the live CHECK — a `created_by` /
 *   `updated_by` beyond 100 chars, OR a key outside the closed set {created_at, created_by,
 *   updated_at, updated_by} — 400s the WHOLE request, nothing created. Both are clauses of the
 *   same live CHECK the delivered contract documents for the metadata PATCH family, applied here
 *   too since create writes the same constrained column; a stray/typo'd key is otherwise silently
 *   persisted here and rejected upstream (Rainer review, LLMO-6288 rework).
 * - Quota-metered like every other prompt-create path: the whole batch 405s (creates nothing)
 *   over the workspace's prompt allocation — metered on the NEW-item count only (a dedupe hit
 *   costs nothing), mirroring the v2 create paths' `existing_count` accounting.
